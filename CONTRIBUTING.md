# Get Your Environment Ready

The following information is provided to help you get up and contributing as quickly as possible. If you need help, please feel free to stop by our discord channel and reach out anytime! [Bald Bearded Builder Discord][DISCORD].

## Visual Studio Code

We use Visual Studio Code as our preferred development editor, but you can use whichever editor you're must comfortable with. However, if you decide to use Visual Studio Code we have provided a workspace which includes the recommended extensions as well as default tasks and launch settings so you can easily get up and contributing and testing your code easily.

One of the first things you should do when you launch Visual Studio Code is run the `setupenv` task which will install the required node modules (both locally and globally).

1. Press your **F1** key
1. Type, **Task: Run Task**
1. Choose **Setup Environment**

Next you'll need to copy the `.env-example` file and rename it to `.env` then complete the following:

## Environment Varbiables

Before you get started, you will need to gather some information (and possibly create an account) from multiple endpoints we use. For example, you will need know your Twitch channel ID, client ID and secret.

- Visit your **Stream Key & Preferences** page: `https://dashboard.twitch.tv/u/<your-twitch-name>/settings/channel` 
- Click the **Show** button within the *Primary Stream key* setting
- Select the number between the _ (underscore) characters. For example, your Twitch ID would be **1234567890** using the following example: `live_1234567890_xasdfAdafsaSDfasdfAd79S`
- Copy your *Twitch ID* to the `.env` **TWITCH_CHANNEL_ID** value

#### Create a Twitch API extension

- Visit the [Twitch Developers](https://dev.twitch.tv) webpage and login to your account
- Click the **Create an Extension** button
- Name the extension something memorable to you. For example: `number-one-bot`
- Copy the *Twitch API Client ID* and add it to the `.env` **TWITCH_CLIENT_ID** value
- Click the **Extension Settings** button in the upper-right corner of the page
- Click the **Generate Secret** button, then copy the result to the `.env` **TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET** value
- Change the OAuth Redirect URL to: `https://localhost:3000`

#### Get your Twitch Bot OAuth token

- Visit the [Twitch Chat OAuth Password Generator]() and click the **Connect** button
- Once you log in, you'll be presented with your OAuth token. Copy this token to the `.env` **TWITCH_BOT_AUTH_TOKEN** value

### Fauna DB

- Click on the **Account API Keys** near the bottom of the page
- In the *Create Key* section, create a new admin key. Once you click the *Create New Admin Key* button, copy the secret key to the `.env` **FAUNADB_SECRET** value
